user_registration:
  help: |+
    Allow new users to register themselves with this instance of tkellem, rather than having to create all users through the tkellem console. Set to 'open' to allow self-registration, 'verified' to allow self-registration but require admin approval before activation, any other value means closed registration.

    If you enable this, you should configure recaptcha as well, see the help for the recaptcha_api_key setting.

    New users will register themselves by connecting to tkellem with a username but no password and no network specified. The tkellem bot will walk them through the process.

recaptcha_api_key:
  help: |+
    Configure the recaptcha API key for public registrations. Generate a key by visiting http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/apikey . Then set this setting to the value 

    <public key>,<private key>

    That is, the public key, then a comma, then the private key. This will protect user self-signups behind a recaptcha check.
